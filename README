Author: Rob Friesel

Author URI: http://blog.founddrama.net/

Version: 0.1a

NOTES:
- CSS is developed and managed using Sass: <http://sass-lang.com/>; the author
  recommends that you work it into your deploy script.

@todo
- The site references minified versions of certain resources (e.g., css and js
  files); the author recommends a built script to handle creating these
  minified files and putting them in the right place
- - A sample deploy script is included at ./dev/deploy.sh
